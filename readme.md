This repository contains a replica of the thisisdigital.co.uk website, created for the purpose of learning web development. The project aims to replicate the design and functionality of the original website using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library. While the project is still in progress, it has already provided valuable insights and learning opportunities to me.

Project Overview**

The main objective of this project is to replicate the design and features of the thisisdigital.com website. By creating this replica, I aim to gain hands-on experience with modern web development technologies and deepen my understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and animation libraries like GSAP.

### Technologies Used
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript
4. GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

### Learning Highlights
Through this project, I have had the opportunity to:

**Apply HTML and CSS Concepts:** Replicating the intricate design of the original website required a solid understanding of HTML5 and CSS3, including layout techniques, positioning, and styling.

**Explore JavaScript:** Implementing interactive elements and animations allowed me to practice JavaScript coding and DOM manipulation.

**Utilize GSAP Library:** Incorporating the GSAP library enhanced my animation capabilities, enabling smooth and engaging animations for a better user experience.

**Project Organization:** Structuring the project files, managing assets, and writing clean code are essential skills I've improved upon.

### Project Status
The project is currently in progress. I have successfully recreated several sections of their Landing Page, focusing on accuracy and attention to detail. While the replica is not yet responsive, this is a planned aspect of the project's evolution.

### Future Plans
The following are planned steps for the project:

- Make the website fully responsive to ensure optimal viewing across various devices and screen sizes.
- Implement remaining sections and features of the original website.
- Refine animations and interactions for a polished user experience.
- Optimize the codebase for performance and maintainability.
